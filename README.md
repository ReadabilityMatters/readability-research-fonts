# Readability Research Fonts with Width and Spacing Variations

# Overview
This repository provides font files based on text format settings used in several readability research studies that explored their effects on reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension. Readability Matters developed five versions of the free Google variable font, RobotoFlex, with modifications to letter spacing and/or character width. We are now making these available for individual or research use.

# Access and Usage
The fonts are provided for research and personal use to advance the understanding of how text format influences reading outcomes. More details can be found at https://readabilitymatters.org/free-fonts-add-character-spacing-and-width.
